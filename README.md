# Ēriks Buivids
### My background
Hello there, I’m Ēriks. I’m a translator; however, I have been carrying out the duties of an interpreter for quite some time as well.
In case you might wonder how a translator differs from an interpreter and vice versa, then the short answer would be that a translator works primarily with written texts and renders a translation into another language in a written form.
As for interpreters, they perform the same actions as translators do, with the only difference that they translate in a spoken form.
Here is a [reference](https://skrivanek.lv/tulkotajs-pret-tulks/) clarifying the same notions in the Latvian language.

When doing written translations, I not only translated from one language into another but I also had to solve some formatting issues, which required more-than-basic knowledge of PCs.
Depending on the project, this might have sometimes taken me even several days to accomplish.
Probably my interest in IT indirectly spawns from spending countless hours editing my projects and reading materials on how to solve PC/software-related problems.

By the way, with the translation industry flourishing in terms of technological developments, people in my profession tend to use so-called CAT-tools (specific software), but don’t be led astray – it has nothing to do with actual cats. :cat:
### Other details
I have a wide range of interests, but somehow over the years I have developed a liking for gardening (a motivator to force myself to get some fresh air more often).
I love doing sports, too. By the way, here is a picture from a running race around summertime a couple of years ago. I think I even got the podium.
